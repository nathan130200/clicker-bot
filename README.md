# Clicker Bot
Auto clicker for clicker games, so you don't have to break your mouse or have your hands hurt from clicking so much.

# Building 
1. Clone repo.
2. Open `"roblox-clicker-game.sln"` in your VS2022 (with C++ development features and latest VC Redist)
3. Goto `"controls.h"` and modify as you want.
3. Hit `"Build"` (or CTRL+Shift+B)
4. Grab executable files in `"bin/Debug"` (don't matter if Debug or Release this code is already optimized)
5. Have fun!

# Controls
By default i had made this code initially for some clicker games in roblox. But for better testing i've replaced all code to fit in `"Kiwi Clicker"` game:
- `F2` toggle clicker on/off (This will emit a short beep to indicate if is enabled or not)
- `F4` quit

By default in kiwi clicker i had prepared some controls:
- Auto press `S` (spam clicking in security) and `[SPACE]` (spam click to earn kiwis)
- Regular mouse spam click too.
